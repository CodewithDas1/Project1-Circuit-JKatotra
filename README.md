# Arduino Project 1-Circuit-JKatotra
Project Overview
This project implements a basic LED blink circuit using Arduino Uno, breadboard, and C++ programming. The circuit controls an LED with custom timing intervals using digital output on pin 13.

Components Used
Arduino Uno R3
Breadboard
LED (Red)
220Ω Resistor
Jumper Wires

Circuit Design
The circuit connects:

Arduino Pin 13 → 220Ω Resistor → LED Anode (+)

LED Cathode (-) → Arduino GND

Code Features
Custom Delay Times: 750ms ON,
